# hello-world
I'm a newbie to programming, so I just started drinking lots of coffee ;)
I'm a student at CUNY School of Professional Studies taking a free bridge workshop on R programming, so that I can enroll in a Masters in Data Science degree program starting in Spring 2018.
I'm also going to try to attend the free bridge workshops on the topics of Data Science Math and SQL, though they are not required.
